## This code unpacks a database containing complaints filed against Chicago Police officers by the people of Chicago

### The database has three parts - the first on accused officers, second on complainants (victims) and the third on investigating officers

The code looks at various parameters and plots them using the interactive Bokeh library. Some of the parameters include gender-wise
and race-wise analysis of accused officers, age-wise study of the victims, and of the types of complaints registered
